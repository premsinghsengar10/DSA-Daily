# 📘 DSA-Daily

DSA-Daily is a personal **Data Structures & Algorithms practice repository**.  
It contains daily problem-solving implementations written in **C++**, organized topic-wise for easy learning and revision.

This repository is created to build consistency, strengthen problem-solving skills, and prepare for **coding interviews** and **competitive programming**.

---

## 🚀 Purpose of This Repository

- Practice **DSA daily**
- Improve logical thinking and coding efficiency
- Maintain a structured record of solved problems
- Revise important concepts before interviews
- Track personal learning progress over time

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Arrays
- Binary Search
- Binary Trees
- Sorting Techniques
- (More topics will be added regularly)
